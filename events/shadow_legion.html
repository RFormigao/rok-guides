During the event, a large number of Black Fortress will appear on the map.
Once the event starts, the Black Fortress will send armies that will march to attack the cities of alliance members.

Date: <b>02/14 - 20:00 UTC</b>

<b><color=navy>Pay attention to the strategies below:</color></b>

1. Use effective damage and resistance commanders in the garrison;
2. It is important to stay in the city to defend yourself with all the troops garrisoned, the damage we do will be much greater thanks to the maximum capacity of the city;
3. Take advantage of any Defense, Attack or Health Sacred Places rune;
4. As we advance, overcoming the waves, they will become much more resistant and difficult to defeat, so we can request reinforcement of our city from the Alliance members;
5. Boosting in other players' cities also gives you extra points. Reinforcement is only recommended when you miss your two opportunities;
6. Use attack or defense buff items such as Attack or Defense Advanced 12h|24h;
7. Do not leave the alliance during the event or your individual credits will be reset;
8. Each governor can only send a single march to attack the Legion, in case he wants to do more damage through another pair of commanders, but as we said it is better to stay in our garrison during the event;
9. Peace Shields are not effective against Legion of Shadows, so don't try to use them if you plan to get rid of this event;
10. Using TP will count as a loss; therefore, you will only have one more chance to defeat Legion of Shadows;
11. When Lost Kingdom opens, if you start the event there, you will not be able to play it in your original kingdom and vice versa.
12. If at least 15 members survive the 25 waves, the alliance will unlock the next difficulty of the event. The new difficulty option will be visible the next time the event occurs.

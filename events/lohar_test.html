• I advise you to attack level 21 to 25 barbarians to benefit from better exp, resources, gems, accelerator bonus.
• To avoid wasting your action points, use commanders with peacekeeping talents
• Keep your <color=#1B5B10>Lohar's Longbow (green)</color> and <color=#186BC4>Lohar's Shield (blue)</color> for the end of the event so you can collect more by killing barbarians.

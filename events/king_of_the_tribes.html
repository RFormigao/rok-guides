<b><size=28>Event - King of the tribes - Rules</size></b>

When this event appears, destroy <b><color=maroon>barbarian forts</color></b> to earn event points for your alliance according to the rules below:

1. During the event, governors can earn event points for their alliance by destroying <b><color=maroon>barbarian forts</color></b>.
The <b>more members participate in each rally</b> and the <b>higher the level of the destroyed fort</b>, the more points you earn.

2. Once the alliance points total reaches the specified value, all current alliance members will receive a reward for this stage.
(Governors who joined the alliance after a stage ends will not receive the reward for that stage.)

3. Alliances will be ranked based on total points earned.
After the event, all members of alliances that were listed in the Top 20 of the realm will receive additional ranking rewards.

4. Each governor can claim rewards for each phase of the event at most once.
Rewards will not be received a second time, even if the governor changes alliances during the event.

Let's all get organized and have a great event.
